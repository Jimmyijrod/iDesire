                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The iDesire Private Ltd has continually given back to society on several occasions since its founding, with a strong emphasis on corporate social responsibility. As early as the company's first month of business, it supported the "Plant a Tree" campaign, followed by helping those in need during lockdown, giving De-ssups goodie packs, and even supporting the young monks of the Karma Lekseling Foundation in Paro. An inherent part of the company's mission to better society is reflected in the name "iDesire", which signifies that the company desires to give back to society. Mr. Parsu Ram Biswa, the chairman, was personally touched by HRH Ashi Deki Yangzom Wangchuck's kindness, which enabled him to attend Ugyen Academy in Punakha as a high school student. As a way of saying thanks and giving back, iDesire has agreed to cover the cost of scholarships for students wishing to complete their three years of graduation at Norbuling Rigter College. Four students have so far received scholarships from iDesire to attend Norbuling Rigter College to pursue BBA/BCom. All of the clients at the iDesire group of companies have our sincere gratitude for their trust, confidence, and assistance thus far. We look forward to the chance to continue providing even more devoted and committed service to our clients from all business units&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>With the theme of “Making Menstruation a Normal Fact of Life by 2030”, and to help all perceive Menstruation 🩸 as a biological phenomenon, the Male members of the team gifted Sanitary Pads to their fellow Female colleagues at the office premises followed by an open discussion about Menstrual Hygiene among each other. 
<br>The Management also assured that all necessary support will be provided to the female team members if required during their cycles. 
<br>While it’s okay to talk happily about birth, then let’s all together make it okay to talk freely about Menstruation as well. 
<br>Cheers!

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-0 display-4">To mark the celebration of the 113th National Day, team iDesire organized a cleaning campaign as we felt that one of the best possible ways to celebrate National Day could be to make our beautiful Nation even more cleaner in little way we can.
<br>Keeping the Covid-19 precautions in mind, the numbers of volunteers were kept limited and a diminutive team of only 18 volunteers carried out the whole activity.
<br>As we continue to live amidst such pristine environments, we express our deepest gratitude to our farsighted and enlightened Monarchs for all the blessings we have collectively received as a Nation and our profound prayers for continued peace and happiness for our country and our fellow citizens under the compassionate leadership of our beloved His Majesty The King.&nbsp;</p>
